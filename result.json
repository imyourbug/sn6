The event was part of a nationwide wave of demonstrations against far-right ideology and racism, and in support of an open society. The event took place after the National Rally (RN) came first in the European elections in France and President Emmanuel Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly on 9 June 2024, prompting snap legislative elections, raising fears of a government led by the far-right party. The demonstrators also expressed solidarity for the 'New 'Popular Front' (Nouveau Front Populaire) alliance (left-wing) ahead of the upcoming legislative elections.",

The event was part of a nationwide wave of demonstrations called by CFDT, CGT, UNSA, SUD, and FSU, as well as more than 200 feminist organizations such as MFPF, NT, and Oxfam, condemning far-right ideology, which the demonstrators deemed dangerous to women's rights. The event took place after the National Rally (RN) came first in the European elections in France and President Emmanuel Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly on 9 June 2024, prompting snap legislative elections, raising fears of a government led by the far-right party.",
